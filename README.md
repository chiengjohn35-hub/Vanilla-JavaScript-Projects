# Vanilla-JavaScript-Projects
This repository conains <b> front-end practice projects built with HTML,CSS and Vanilla Javascript </b>



## Why Vanilla Javascript?
As a beginer, I chose to focus on the <b> core front-end fundamentals </b> before moving into frameworks and <b>full-stack development </b>. Learning Vanilla JavaScript helps me understand how DOM works, how interactivity is built, and how JavaScripts behave in the browser-without abstractions.
This fundation prepares me to confidently move into <b>React.js and Django </b> for full-stack development.



## My Journey

These Projects document my learning learning progress. They may be small, but each one strengthens my problem-solving skills and understanding of JavaScript Fundamentals. 
The journey reminds me-and-others-that consistent practice make growth possible.
